## Reflections

#### While reading the paragraphs below, please take into account - it's hard to describe what you learnt new from the material if you already knew it. Thanks.

1. The `Getting Started with TypeScript` module explains how typscript works, how to install it, and what code editors can be used. Since this is not my first time working with typescript, I didn't learn anything new in this module.

2. The `Declare Variable Types in TypeScript` module talks about types, what they are and how they differ, and how to create them. What is Enum and how it can be used. Useful for me: reiterate the difference between unknown and any

3. The `Implement Interfaces in TypeScript` module talks about interfaces, what they are and how they differ, how to create and extend them. What is Enum and how it can be used. This is all known information, to me.

4. The `Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript` module explains the benefits of using types in functions, what kind of parameters it has. Unexpected for me was the opportunity to define function types using interfaces. But where would it come in handy?

5. The `Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript` module explain how we can use TypeScript classes, how we can describe the shape of objects. It shows when to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object. This information was also not new to me.

6. The `Generics in TypeScript` module showed us use cases for generics. How to use it with: functions, interfaces, classes. Most information was already known for me, however generics are a very powerful tool and because of this the topic was not fully covered.

7. The `Work with External Libraries` module showed us hot to import \ export modules. Did you find anything new here? Neither did I.

8. The `Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript` module explained us the purpose of namespaces, what kinds of things they are. No one knows what they are for or where to use them, in real life. I hope to find out someday.
