Hi, my name is Dmitry. I’m from Gomel, Belarus. I am not yet a junior
frontend developer, as many students say, but I want to become one,
so that’s why I am here. In 2019 I graduated from Francisk Skorina
State University. I finished faculty of foreign languages and I am an
English teacher, according to my diploma. But I've been an auto parts
sales manager for over 5 years now because … I think I don't need to
explain why a man works with cars and not as a teacher, at least in our
country. I came there with almost no knowledge, but I got the hang of
it very quickly. And after a few years I began to notice that I had
reached a certain level and there was nowhere else to grow in my
career. That was the first time when I thought about changing careers.
The reason for the second time were the last two, or even, three
years. They have shown that the profession of a developer allows you
to have mobility. I mean, even in case some relocation or similar
situation, you still have the opportunity of not retraining and
continuing to do what you were doing before. Programming is the
same, in any part of the world. Yeah, I know that not everything is
perfect, and as said one purple guy in famous movie- reality is often
disappointing (Tanos), but everything is relative. Compare the
profession of a developer to any other profession, such as a teacher or
a sales manager

Like many people, I chose the frontend because I can see what I'm
doing and what is changing, immediately while I'm coding. Also,
javascript allows, eventually, to combine frontend with backend
development, what is becoming a standard requirement for the
profession, or, even, do mobile application, without changing the
language. I started coding a year and a half ago but I have had to take
breaks from my studies. But now I'm here again and I'm ready to move
on. As I wanted to, I learn something new every day and have the
opportunity to create something without leaving the computer. And I
really like it. I can't say that everything comes easy to me, but I really
love the feeling of being successful. To set a goal and achieve it.

Every stage 1 ends with the development of a game. This year was no
exception. About a year ago, I would have said it was hard enough: to
make a game - is not the same as making a website. But today, I have
no longer the feeling that I don't know how to do it at all. I write my
code using classes. The reason is - I can't figure out how to write code
using functions in vanilla javascript, because I don't know how to
organise it properly. And now I'm thinking it might be time for start
using libraries.
Well, I think that's enough for a short self-presentation. Thank you for
watching this video till the end!
